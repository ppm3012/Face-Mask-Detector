# Face-Mask-Detector
training a COVID-19 face mask detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow

# The notebook include
1.training the COVID-19 face mask detector
2.detect face mask in an image
3.detect face mask in a real-time video

# Training Part
By using the face mask detection dataset, train the model by using Tensorflow/Keras

# Deployment Part
Load the detector and perform face detection (Mask/NoMask)
